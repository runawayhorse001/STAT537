## Load data

```{R}
uri = paste0("./data/ex8-32.TXT")
hw8data = read.table(uri, header = T)
attach(hw8data)
hw8data=data.frame(value=c(A,B,C,D), group=rep(LETTERS[1:4], each=length(A)))
```

### Analysis

* (1). Hypothesis test
    + P value = 5.85e-05, reject $H_{0}$
    + Conclusion: not all means are equal among the four groups.

```{R}
hw8data.aov = aov(value~group, hw8data)
summary(hw8data.aov)
```


* (2). Levene's test
    + P value = 0.6428
    + The assumption of homegeneity of variance among the four groups is appropriate.
    
```{R warning=F, message=F}
library(car)
leveneTest(value~group, data=hw8data)
```

* (3). Check residuals

The normal QQ plot indicates a normal distribution fits the residuals well.

```{R}
plot(hw8data.aov, which=2)
```

* (4). Significantly different groups based on Tukey's HSD test
    + A-B, A-C, B-D, B-D
    + Group C has the highest average; Group D has the lowest average.
    + No significant difference between group A and D
    + No significant difference between group B and C
  

```{R}
TukeyHSD(hw8data.aov)
plot(value~group, data=hw8data)
```

* (5). Kruskal-Wallis test
    + P value = 0.0008698
    + Conclusion: at least two of these four groups have different distributions.
    
```{R}
kruskal.test(value~group, data=hw8data)
```
