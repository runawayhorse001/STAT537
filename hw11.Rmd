## Load data

```{R}
data165 = read.table("./data/ex16-5.TXT", header = T)
```

## Problem 16.5 (b)

```{R warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
lm.fit = lm(RISK~NOCIG, data=data165)
coefEst = coef(lm.fit)
ggplot(data165, aes(x=NOCIG, y=RISK)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = coefEst[1], slope = coefEst[2], col="blue") +
  xlab("Number of cigarattes smoked") +
  ylab("Risk index of CVD")
```

## Problem 16.6 (b)

```{R}
lmCov = lm(RISK~NOCIG+TREATMENT+NOCIG:TREATMENT, data=data165)
anova(lmCov)
pval = as.character(anova(lmCov)$`Pr(>F)`); pval
```

The p-value for the interaction term (NOCIG:TREATMENT) is `r pval[3]` > 0.05. We **cannot reject** the $H_{0}$ that the slopes for the three treatments are eqaul. 

Below is a scatterplot grouped by treatments, also showing a very weak evidence of equal slopes for the three treatments.

```{R}
coefC = coef(lm(RISK~NOCIG, data=data165[data165$TREATMENT=="C", ])); coefC
coefI = coef(lm(RISK~NOCIG, data=data165[data165$TREATMENT=="I", ])); coefI
coefII = coef(lm(RISK~NOCIG, data=data165[data165$TREATMENT=="II", ])); coefII

ggplot(data165, aes(x=NOCIG, y=RISK, col=TREATMENT)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = coefC[1], slope = coefC[2], col="red") +
  geom_abline(intercept = coefI[1], slope = coefI[2], col="green") +
  geom_abline(intercept = coefII[1], slope = coefII[2], col="blue") +
  xlab("Number of cigarattes smoked") +
  ylab("Risk index of CVD")
```

## Problem 16.6 (b)

```{R}
lmCov = lm(RISK~NOCIG+TREATMENT, data=data165)
anova(lmCov)
pval = as.character(anova(lmCov)$`Pr(>F)`); pval
```

Yes. The p-value for TREATMENT is **`r pval[2]`**, indicating a strong evidence of difference in the mean risk index for the three treatments.
